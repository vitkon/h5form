You'll find source code in the `src` subdirectory!\n\n### Code style\nRegarding code style like indentation and whitespace, **follow the conventions you see used in the source already.**\n\n### PhantomJS\nWhile grunt can run the included unit tests via [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/), this shouldn't be considered a substitute for the real thing. Please be sure to test the `test/*.html` unit test file(s) in _actual_ browsers.\n\nSee the [Why does grunt complain that PhantomJS isn't installed?](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/faq.md#why-does-grunt-complain-that-phantomjs-isnt-installed) guide in the [Grunt FAQ](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/faq.md) for help with installing or troubleshooting PhantomJS.\n\n## Modifying the code\nFirst, ensure that you have the latest [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/) installed.\n\nTest that grunt is installed globally by running `grunt --version` at the command-line.  If grunt isn't installed globally, run `npm install -g grunt` to install the latest version. _You may need to run `sudo npm install -g grunt`._\n\n_Note that in Windows, you may have to run `grunt.cmd` instead of `grunt`._\n\n1. Fork and clone the repo.\n1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies (including grunt).\n1. Run `grunt` to grunt this project.\n\nAssuming that you don't see any red, you're ready to go. Just be sure to run `grunt` after making any changes, to ensure that nothing is broken.\n\n## Submitting pull requests\n\n1. Create a new branch, please don't work in your `master` branch directly.\n1. Add failing tests for the change you want to make. Run `grunt` to see the tests fail.\n1. Fix stuff.\n1. Run `grunt` to see if the tests pass. Repeat steps 2-4 until done.\n1. Open `test/*.html` unit test file(s) in actual browser to ensure tests pass everywhere.\n1. Update the documentation to reflect any changes.\n1. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":2056}]],"length":2056}
